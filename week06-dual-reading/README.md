## Discussion Focus

How does demonstrating competence and responsibility differ when you have formal authority (corporate) versus when you must earn it through contribution (open source)?

## Question Guidelines

Your question can focus on ONE chapter OR connect concepts from BOTH. Consider:

- How do "I Got This" signals work in a corporate hierarchy vs. open source project?
- What does it mean to "manage participants" without formal authority?
- How is trust earned differently in these two contexts?

## Submission

Create a file named `lastname-firstname.md` in the `questions/` folder with your question.

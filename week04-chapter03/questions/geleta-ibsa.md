## Question

Chapter 3 defines "Constructive Loyalty" as a strategic partnership where helping your boss succeed creates the incentive for them to help you. However, if a manager’s definition of "success" (like meeting a short-term deadline) directly conflicts with the long-term health of a project, does practicing constructive loyalty risk becoming "destructive" to the organization? How does an employee navigate the "currency of loyalty" when the boss’s immediate win requires the employee to compromise their professional standards?

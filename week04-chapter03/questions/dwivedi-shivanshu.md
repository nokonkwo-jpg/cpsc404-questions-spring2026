## Question

The chapter suggests that professionals build trust by setting realistic commitments, delivering reliably, and publicly supporting leadership decisions even when information is incomplete. However, early-career employees often have limited control over scope changes, shifting priorities, and last-minute urgent work.

When deadlines slip due to unrealistic planning or changing constraints, how should responsibility be fairly distributed between managers and employees? Additionally, if senior leadership makes a strategic or technical mistake in front of clients, how can junior professionals balance maintaining a united front with their obligation to ensure technical accuracy? When does professional loyalty require private pushback rather than public agreement?

## Question

This chapter warns strongly against criticizing your manager with your colleagues, arguing that it damages the loyalty relationship. How bad is it really to vent a little with coworkers who are in the same boat with you? And does the answer change depending on whether you're venting about your manager's decisions, their competence, or them as a person?

## Context (optional)

I believe colleagues play an important part in your work life as they understand your daily frustrations in ways friends and family outside work simply can't. Sometimes friendships with coworkers are built from sharing the same trauma and hardship, and that makes work life less miserable.Also it's not always easy to just change companies if you don't like your boss (p36), sometimes you just need to live with it and make the best of the situation.

\## Question



Chapter 3 argues that managers “live in fear,” particularly due to uncertainty, loss of control, and decision-making with inadequate information. If constructive loyalty is partly about reducing your manager’s uncertainty and not making their fears worse, does that shift the employee’s role from simply performing technical work to actively managing upward psychologically? At what point does supporting a manager’s insecurity become emotional labor rather than professional responsibility?



\## Context (optional)



The chapter suggests that loyalty helps stabilize the manager during uncertainty and crisis. This question explores whether constructive loyalty is purely strategic career alignment, or whether it also requires employees to absorb some of the psychological burden of management.

## Question

While constructive loyalty seems to be a great strategy for maintaining good relationship at work, as it was mentioned in the book, managers tend to have a fast turnaround, together with most junior developers. Such long-term loyalty cannot be formed in half a year. What other mechanisms might exist for systems with such fast turnaround, or are they inherently less efficient and suffer communcation issues?

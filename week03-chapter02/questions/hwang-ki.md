# Week 3 Question - Chapter 2: Giving Good-Enough Answers

## Question
If a manager is already a strong technical expert, does using a “good-enough” answer—one that includes some speculation or incomplete data actually build constructive loyalty? Or can it instead signal shallow understanding or a failure to meet the culture’s baseline standard of excellence?

## Context (optional)
In the firms where I’ve interned and will work full-time, many managers were very technical and understood the same systems I worked on. Their questions often seemed less about lacking knowledge and more about inviting alternative views. In such environments, the “Game of School” and the “Game of Business” might overlap more than the book suggests.

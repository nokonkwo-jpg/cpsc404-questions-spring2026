## Question

Dr. Kousen lists the typical traits of a bad manager, i.e. the manager is either inexperienced as a manager, or too incompetent to have already moved higher up the ranks. This classification comes from the assumption that everyone would want to achieve high in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

However, I would ask, what if the manager, in fact, _doesn't_ want to achieve higher levels in the hierarhcy of needs, and only seeks after monetary needs and some safety? In other words, what if the manager does not seek the professionalism ("\[caring\] more about the technical details of their job than simply making another dollar for the company") as described by Dr. Kousen? This, I believe, is more probable for the "rookie managers" that he describes because those early in their career are less likely to "know what they're doing," making them really only seek the needs in the lower levels of the hierarchy.

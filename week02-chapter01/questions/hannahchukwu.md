# Week 2 Question - Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

**Student:** Hannah Chukwu

## Question
If conflict between employees and managers is inevitable, as HYBHY suggests, is it realistic to expect employees to turn conflict into collaboration when managers still hold most of the power?

## Context (optional)
In Chapter 1 of Help Your Boss Help You, conflict is described as something that naturally happens because employees and managers often have different goals and pressures. Since managers have more authority, employees may avoid speaking up or challenging decisions, even when they disagree, because it can feel risky.
The book encourages employees to approach conflict collaboratively instead of personally, but this can be difficult when power dynamics and fear of negative consequences are involved. While productivity can exist where employee and manager goals overlap, reaching that point may not always be realistic without support from leadership.

# Week 2 – Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

## Question
HYBHY argues conflict is inevitable and can be productive if handled well. Say you are working on a project with an senior employee. They propose to use an out of date technology and you are confident you know a much better subsitute, how would you approach this situation to make the conflict productive rather than personal. If the project continues to move forward with the outdated technology, how would you control the difficulty of working on a project that you are confident is getting done incorrectly. How would you let this frustration not effect your work.


## Context
I feel I have found myself occasionally in similar situations, when working on group projects in the past, or during my internship experience. This is something I need to work on as I graduate and begin joining teams full time. Once I have an idea and my brain starts flowing I find I can favor my idea which can potentially cloud my vision for accepting other approaches which could be better. However, I have also experienced the opposite situation. During my internship this summer, when the person I reported to would suggest a different approach, I often defaulted to their idea. At times, this was because I questioned my own perspective or worried that pushing back might come across as disrespectful or highlight my inexperience. As a result, I sometimes held back ideas that could have meaningfully contribute to the teams success.

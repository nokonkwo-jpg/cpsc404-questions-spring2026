# Week 2 Question - Chapter 1: Making Inevitable Conflict Productive

**Student:** Kenneth Kousen
**Date:** January 28, 2026

## Question

The chapter argues that conflict is inevitable because managers and employees have fundamentally different agendas. But in flat organizations or self-managing teams (increasingly common in tech), these traditional hierarchies don't exist. Does the "differing agendas" framework still apply when everyone is essentially a peer, or do we need a different mental model for productive conflict in non-hierarchical settings?

## Context

I'm thinking about this in relation to ProducingOSS principles we'll read later - open source projects rarely have formal hierarchies, yet they still have conflict. Is it the *same kind* of conflict, or does the absence of a formal boss-employee relationship change the nature of disagreement fundamentally?
